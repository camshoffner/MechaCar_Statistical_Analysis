## Linear Regress to Predict MPG

* Which variable / coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* Does this linear model predict mpg of mechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Study Design: MechCar vs Competition
When buying a car for a family, safety ratings are often scrutinized.  In this analysis the null hypothesis claims that there is no indication that better performance and higher price of the car does not relate to the safety rating.  The alternative hypothesis claims that more expensive cars with better performance features have higher safety ratings. Linear regression and a Chi-Squared test will evaluate the hypothesis and give light on the analysis.
